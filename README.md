# 🚀 Mastering Recursion in C++

Welcome to my **Recursion Learning Repository**! This repository contains my journey of exploring **Recursion in C++** with various implementations and examples.

## 🔥 Why Learn Recursion?
Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It helps in breaking down complex problems into simpler ones and is widely used in:

- **Mathematical Computations** ➗ (Factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, etc.)
- **Data Structures** 🌳 (Tree Traversal, Graph Algorithms, etc.)
- **Dynamic Programming** ⚡ (Optimal Substructure problems)
- **Backtracking** 🔄 (Maze solving, N-Queens, etc.)

## 📁 What’s Inside?
This repository includes recursive implementations such as:
✅ Factorial Calculation  
✅ Fibonacci Sequence  
✅ Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)  
✅ Tower of Hanoi  
✅ Merge Sort & Quick Sort  
✅ Sum of Digits & Power Calculation  

## 📜 How to Use?
Clone the repository and compile any file to explore recursion:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pratham-16/Recursion-Learning.git  
cd Recursion-Learning  
g++ filename.cpp -o output  
./output  
```
